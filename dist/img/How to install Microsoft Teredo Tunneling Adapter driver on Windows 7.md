## What is Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter?
 
Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter is a virtual device that enables Windows computers to use IPv6 addresses over an IPv4 network. IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, which assigns unique identifiers to devices on the Internet. IPv4 is the previous version, which has a limited number of available addresses. As more and more devices connect to the Internet, IPv6 is needed to avoid address exhaustion and ensure compatibility.
 
However, not all networks and devices support IPv6 yet. Therefore, Windows uses a technique called tunneling to encapsulate IPv6 packets inside IPv4 packets and send them over an IPv4 network. This way, Windows can communicate with other devices that use IPv6, even if they are on different networks. Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter is one of the tunneling protocols that Windows supports, along with 6to4 and ISATAP.
 
## Why do I need Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter?
 
Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter is useful for applications that require IPv6 connectivity, such as Xbox Live or Forza Horizon 3. These applications use a service called Xbox Live Party Chat, which allows users to communicate with each other using voice or text. Xbox Live Party Chat uses IPv6 to establish peer-to-peer connections between users, without relying on a central server. This improves the quality and reliability of the communication.
 
However, if your network or device does not support IPv6, you will not be able to use Xbox Live Party Chat or play online mode in Forza Horizon 3. Therefore, you need Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter to enable IPv6 connectivity over an IPv4 network and join the party.
