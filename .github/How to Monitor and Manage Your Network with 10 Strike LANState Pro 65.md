## Network Scanning and Discovery
  
One of the first steps to manage your network is to know what devices are connected to it and how they are arranged. 10 Strike LANState Pro 65 can automatically scan your network and detect device types and addresses. It can also use SNMP to discover the network topology and draw links between devices and switches. You can also add devices manually or import them from CSV files.
  
## Graphic Network Map
  
After scanning your network, you can create a graphic map with vector device icons. You can customize the map layout, colors, fonts, backgrounds, and shapes. You can also add widgets and indicators to display critical parameters such as CPU load, disk space, temperature, bandwidth, etc. The map shows the current status of each device (up or down) and changes color when an alarm occurs. You can also export the map to MS Visio or save it as an image file.
  
## Device Monitoring and Alerts
  
10 Strike LANState Pro 65 can monitor various parameters of your network devices such as ping response time, TCP port availability, SNMP information, service status, disk space, etc. You can set up thresholds and conditions for each parameter and configure the program's response when they are met or violated. For example, you can send SMS notifications via a connected 3G/4G modem or phone, email notifications via the Internet, sound alarms and messages on the screen, execute external commands or scripts, etc.
  
## Device Management
  
Besides monitoring your network devices, you can also manage them using the graphic map. You can access device properties, RDP sessions, web interfaces, registry entries, event logs, processes, services, etc. You can also perform actions such as turning on/off/rebooting/shutting down computers, starting/stopping/restarting services, running applications or commands remotely, etc.
  
## Web Interface
  
Another useful feature of 10 Strike LANState Pro 65 is the web interface that allows you to access your network map remotely from any browser. You can view the map in read-only mode or full control mode (in the Pro version). You can also use the web interface to run applications or commands on remote hosts via user-defined menu items.
